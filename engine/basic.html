<p>The PT6T (Twin-Pac) engine series is a lightweight free turbine engine. It drives one output shaft via a two-stage reduction gearbox. The power section consists of two major assemblies:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The Compressor rotor assembly</li>
    <li>The Power Turbine rotor assembly</li>
</ul>

<p>
The Compressor Rotor assembly has a compressor and a compressor turbine. The Power Turbine rotor assembly has a power turbine and a power turbine shaft. The two assemblies are not connected together. They turn at different speeds and in opposite directions. This design is referred to as a "Free Turbine Engine". It permits the power turbine and the rotor to turn at a constant speed, while the fuel control system schedules any compressor speed (N1) as necessary. Starter cranking torque is low, since only the compressor rotor rotates on start. Engaging the accessory gearbox mounted starter/generator starts the Power Section. The compressor pulls air in the engine via an annular plenum chamber (inlet case). The pressure increases across 3 axial stages and one centrifugal impeller. The air is directed into the combustion chamber. Air enters the combustion chamber via small holes and at the proper compressor speed, the fuel is sprayed in the combustion chamber by 14 fuel nozzles. Two spark igniters located in the combustion chamber ignite the airfuel mixture. The generated hot gases are then directed to the turbine area. At this point, ignition is turned off since a continuous flame exists in the combustion chamber. The hot expanding gases accelerate through the compressor turbine vane ring and cause the compressor turbine to rotate. The gases leaving the compressor turbine are accelerated again as they flow through the power turbine vane ring. The power turbine provides rotational energy to drive the main rotor via the reduction gear train. Gases leaving the power turbine are expelled into the atmosphere by the exhaust duct. The reduction gearbox reduces the power turbine speed to a suitable speed for the aircraft gear train (6,600 rpm). The engine oil supply is contained in three integral oil tanks, which provide oil to lubricate and cool all bearings and gears.
A hydro-pneumatic fuel control system installed on the Accessory Gearbox regulates fuel flow to the fuel nozzles in response to power requirements and flight conditions.</p>
<p>
The fuel system controls the main rotor speed by varying the engine's output power as a function of the load demand set by the pilot. Engine shutdown is accomplished by cutting the fuel going to the fuel nozzles.
